# Polygon Mainnet Flash Loan example

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case, and a basic flash loan use case, working on polygon mainet, using an example account. It comes with a Flash Loan contract, and a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
